# Brunch
HTML5 applications made easy.

Brunch is an assembler for HTML5 applications. It's agnostic to frameworks,
libraries, programming, stylesheet & templating languages and backend
technology.

To simplify app development, brunch watches your files for changes and
automatically wraps your scripts and templates in common.js modules.
All build errors are printed to console. If you have growl / libnotify,
brunch will use them too.

It's like LiveReload or CodeKit plus Grunt, but much more faster,
robust and universal.

## Getting started
You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.6.10+. Type:

    npm install -g brunch

You're done!

To create a new project, execute `brunch new <project name>`.

To build it, execute `brunch build` in project directory.

To continuously rebuild the project on every change, run `brunch watch`.

To run a simple http server, execute `brunch watch --server`.
